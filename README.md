# University Advising System Database

## Overview

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a University Advising System, implemented using SQL for the database backend and ASP.NET for the user interface. The system aims to streamline the advising process within a university, providing a centralized platform for students and advisors to manage academic-related activities.

## Features

- **Student Portal**: Store and manage student details, including personal information, academic records, and program enrollment.

- **Course Management**: Maintain a comprehensive database of available courses, including course details, prerequisites, and scheduling information.

- **Advisor Tools**: Provide advisors with tools to track and manage their assigned students, view academic progress, and facilitate course selection.

- **Admin Page**: A dedicated admin page for system management.

- **User Authentication**: Implement secure user authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access the system.

## Project Structure

- **Database Scripts**: Contains SQL scripts for creating, populating and accessing the database tables.

- **ASP.NET Web Application**: Houses the code for the user interface, including pages for student profiles, advisor dashboards, and appointment scheduling.


## Getting Started

1. **Database Setup**: Execute the SQL scripts in the "Database Scripts" folder to set up the necessary database schema and populate initial data.

2. **ASP.NET Application Setup**: Open the ASP.NET solution in a compatible development environment (e.g., Visual Studio) and configure the connection strings to point to the created database.

3. **Run the Application**: Build and run the ASP.NET application to start the University Advising System.
